## **Best Practices**

### **For Internal Users:**

- Create via admin panel for contractors
- No limits - use freely for testing
- Report bugs directly to dev team

### **For External Test Users:**
- Use for short-term evaluations only
- Monitor usage limits
- Extend if needed (contact sales)
- 30 days is firm - plan accordingly

### **For Beta Testers:**
- Provide regular feedback
- Test new features actively
- Use priority support channel
- Consider upgrading before 90-day expiration

## **Upgrading/Downgrading**

### **External Test ‚Üí Beta:**
```bash
# Remove from external test
DELETE /api/v1/billing/bypass/remove-external-test-user?user_email=user@example.com

# Add to beta
POST /api/v1/billing/bypass/add-beta-tester?user_email=user@example.com
```

### **Beta ‚Üí Paid Customer:**
- Beta expiration triggers normal checkout flow
- Can manually upgrade anytime via dashboard
- Billing system takes over after bypass expires

### **External ‚Üí Paid Customer:**
- After 30 days, normal payment required
- Can upgrade early via dashboard
- Trial period counts toward first month

---

## **Monitoring & Alerts**

### **Admin Dashboard Should Show:**
- List of all external test users with days remaining
- List of all beta testers with days remaining
- Expired trials needing follow-up
- Usage statistics per tier
- Conversion rates (test ‚Üí paid, beta ‚Üí paid)

### **Automated Alerts:**
- 7 days before external test expires
- 14 days before beta expires
- Day of expiration
- Follow-up 3 days after expiration

---

## **FAQ**

**Q: Can external test users access all 4 suites?**
A: No, external test users only get 2 suites (ML + Financial). Beta testers get 3 suites. Only internal users get all 4.

**Q: What happens after trial expires?**
A: For external/beta users, billing bypass ends and normal payment flow begins. They'll see a checkout page to continue using the platform.

**Q: Can we extend external test access beyond 30 days?**
A: Yes, but requires admin action. Either upgrade to beta (90 days) or add custom expiration via admin override.

**Q: Do internal users ever expire?**
A: No, internal users (@pulsebridge.ai emails) have unlimited access forever.

**Q: Can a user be both external test and beta?**
A: No, they can only be in one tier. Beta supersedes external test. Latest addition wins.

## **Migration from Old System**

If you had `TEST_USER_EMAILS` before:
- Existing emails moved to `EXTERNAL_TEST_USER_EMAILS`
- All get 30-day expiration from migration date
- Review and upgrade important users to beta tier
- Internal employees should use company emails

**This tiered system gives you precise control over who can access what, for how long!** üéØ
