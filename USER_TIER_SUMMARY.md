- **Use:** Internal employees, contractors, testing

### **TIER 2: EXTERNAL_TEST (Third-Party)**
- **Who:** External testers added by admin
- **Access:** Limited - only 2 suites (ML + Financial)
- **Limits:** 1K API calls/month, 1GB storage, 3 team members, 5 campaigns
- **Duration:** 30 days then expires
- **Use:** Customer trials, user research, partner evaluations

### **TIER 3: BETA (Early Access)**

## **Quick Reference**

### **Add External Test User (30 days, limited)**
```bash
POST /api/v1/billing/bypass/add-external-test-user?user_email=tester@example.com
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
```

### **Add Beta Tester (90 days, moderate)**
```bash
POST /api/v1/billing/bypass/add-beta-tester?user_email=beta@company.com
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
```

### **Add Internal Employee (unlimited, forever)**
```bash
POST /api/v1/admin/users/internal
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
{
  "email": "employee@pulsebridge.ai",
  "full_name": "John Doe",
  "account_type": "internal_employee",
  "role": "employee"
}

# OR just use @pulsebridge.ai email - automatic!
```

### **List All Bypass Users**
```bash
GET /api/v1/billing/bypass/all-users
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
```

## **What This Solves**

### **Before (Generic Test Users):**
- ‚ùå No distinction between internal and external
- ‚ùå All "test users" had same access
- ‚ùå No expiration dates
- ‚ùå Couldn't track different user types
- ‚ùå Hard to manage trial periods

### **After (Three-Tier System):**
- ‚úÖ Clear separation: Internal vs External vs Beta
- ‚úÖ Different access levels per tier
- ‚úÖ Automatic expiration for external/beta
- ‚úÖ Easy to track by user type
- ‚úÖ Flexible trial management
- ‚úÖ Scalable for growth

### **Internal Tier:**
- PulseBridge employees testing features
- Using PulseBridge as internal CRM/operations tool
- QA and development testing
- Customer success demo accounts
- **No limits, no expiration - use freely**

### **External Test Tier:**
- Prospective customers trying before buying
- User research participants (short-term)
- Partner evaluations
- Market research
- **Limited to prevent abuse, 30-day max**

### **Beta Tier:**

## **What Happens at Expiration**

### **External Test (30 days):**
1. User gets warning at 7 days remaining
2. At expiration, billing bypass ends
3. Normal checkout flow appears
4. Must subscribe to continue

### **Beta (90 days):**
1. User gets warning at 14 days remaining
2. At expiration, billing bypass ends
3. Can extend (admin decision) or must subscribe
4. Typically offered discount for early adopters

### **Internal (never expires):**
- No expiration
- Continues forever
- Internal operations

## **Admin Workflow Examples**

### **Scenario 1: Customer wants to try PulseBridge**
```bash
# Add as external test user (30-day trial)
POST /api/v1/billing/bypass/add-external-test-user?user_email=customer@company.com

# They get:
- 2 suites (ML + Financial)
- 30 days to evaluate
- Limited usage to prevent abuse
- Must upgrade to continue after 30 days
```

### **Scenario 2: Beta program applicant approved**
```bash
# Add as beta tester (90-day extended trial)
POST /api/v1/billing/bypass/add-beta-tester?user_email=beta@startup.com

# They get:
- 3 suites (ML + Financial + AI)
- 90 days to evaluate
- Priority support
- Early access features
- Moderate usage limits
```

### **Scenario 3: New PulseBridge employee hired**
```bash
# Create internal account
POST /api/v1/admin/users/internal
{
  "email": "newemployee@pulsebridge.ai",
  "full_name": "Jane Smith",
  "account_type": "internal_employee",
  "role": "employee",
  "department": "Customer Success"
}

# They get:
- All 4 suites
- Unlimited usage
- Never expires
- Full access immediately
```

### **Scenario 4: External test user wants extension**
```bash
# Option A: Upgrade to beta (90 days, more access)
DELETE /api/v1/billing/bypass/remove-external-test-user?user_email=customer@company.com
POST /api/v1/billing/bypass/add-beta-tester?user_email=customer@company.com

# Option B: Let trial expire, they subscribe
# (Billing flow takes over)
```

## **Migration Notes**

If you had users in the old `TEST_USER_EMAILS` set:
- They're now considered `EXTERNAL_TEST_USER_EMAILS`
- 30-day expiration applies
- Review important users and upgrade to beta if needed
- Internal employees should use company emails

## **Next Steps**

1. **Set up environment variables** (if deploying)
   ```bash
   ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=<generate-strong-key>
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=<secure-password>
   ```

2. **Test the tiers** (after deployment)
   - Add external test user
   - Add beta tester
   - Verify different access levels
   - Check expiration logic

3. **Monitor usage** (ongoing)
   - Track external test ‚Üí paid conversions
   - Track beta ‚Üí paid conversions
   - Monitor trial expirations
   - Follow up on expired trials

4. **Future enhancements** (recommended)
   - Move email lists to database (currently in-memory)
   - Add expiration notification system
   - Create admin dashboard UI
   - Add usage analytics per tier

**You now have precise control over user access!** üéØ

- PulseBridge internal users: Full platform access, forever
- External testers: Limited trial, 30 days
- Beta customers: Extended evaluation, 90 days

Each tier is automatically managed by the billing bypass system!
