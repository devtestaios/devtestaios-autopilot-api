## Core Algorithms

### 1. Budget Allocation (Gradient Ascent Optimization)

**File:** `app/optimization/budget_allocator.py`

**Mathematical Approach:**
```
Revenue Model: Revenue = a * Budget^b
Where: b = 0.8 (diminishing returns exponent)

Marginal ROAS: d(Revenue)/d(Budget) = a * b * Budget^(b-1)

Optimization Goal: Maximize total revenue subject to:
- Total budget constraint: Σ budgets = total_budget
- Min/max per campaign constraints
```

**Algorithm:**
- Gradient ascent to equalize marginal ROAS across campaigns
- Iterative optimization with projected gradients
- Automatic constraint satisfaction
- Convergence detection

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-campaign optimization** - Allocate across any number of campaigns
- **Diminishing returns modeling** - Power law with b=0.8 exponent
- **Constraint handling** - Min/max budget per campaign
- **Cross-platform support** - Allocate across Meta, Google, LinkedIn, etc.
- **Confidence scoring** - Based on data quality and performance

**Usage Example:**
```python
from app.optimization import BudgetAllocator, CampaignPerformance

allocator = BudgetAllocator(learning_rate=0.1, max_iterations=100)

campaigns = [
    CampaignPerformance(
        campaign_id="meta_campaign_001",
        platform="meta",
        current_budget=100.0,
        impressions=10000,
        clicks=500,
        conversions=50,
        spend=100.0,
        revenue=300.0,
        ctr=0.05,
        cpc=0.20,
        cpa=2.0,
        roas=3.0
    ),
    # ... more campaigns
]

allocations = allocator.optimize(
    campaigns=campaigns,
    total_budget=500.0,
    min_budget_per_campaign=10.0,
    max_change_pct=0.5  # Max 50% change
)

for allocation in allocations:
    print(f"{allocation.campaign_id}:")
    print(f"  Current: ${allocation.current_budget:.2f}")
    print(f"  Recommended: ${allocation.recommended_budget:.2f}")
    print(f"  Change: ${allocation.budget_change:.2f} ({allocation.budget_change_pct:.1%})")
    print(f"  Expected ROAS: {allocation.expected_roas:.2f}x")
    print(f"  Confidence: {allocation.confidence:.0%}")
```

### 2. Bid Optimization (Conversion Probability Model)

**File:** `app/optimization/bid_optimizer.py`

**Mathematical Approach:**
```
Optimal Bid Formula:
bid = (avg_order_value * conversion_rate) / target_roas

With contextual adjustments:
- Time-of-day multiplier (peak hours +10%, off-peak -10%)
- Device type multiplier (desktop +15%, mobile -5%)
- Placement multiplier (feed +10%, stories -15%)

Performance-based adjustment:
- If ROAS > target: increase bids (scale up)
- If ROAS < target: decrease bids (scale down)
```

**Algorithm:**
- Estimate conversion rate from historical + recent performance
- Calculate optimal bid based on value and target ROAS
- Apply contextual adjustments (device, time, placement)
- Apply performance multiplier for quick adaptation
- Enforce min/max bid constraints and max change limits

**Key Features:**
- **Real-time bid adjustment** - Respond to performance signals
- **Contextual optimization** - Device, placement, time-of-day aware
- **Dynamic learning** - Weights recent performance vs historical
- **Safety constraints** - Min/max bids, max change percentage
- **Confidence scoring** - Based on data volume and stability

**Usage Example:**
```python
from app.optimization import BidOptimizer, BidContext, PerformanceSnapshot
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

optimizer = BidOptimizer(target_roas=2.0, learning_rate=0.1)

context = BidContext(
    campaign_id="campaign_001",
    ad_set_id="adset_001",
    platform="meta",
    device_type="desktop",
    placement="feed",
    hour_of_day=14,  # 2pm
    historical_cvr=0.05,
    historical_roas=2.5
)

recent_performance = PerformanceSnapshot(
    campaign_id="campaign_001",
    platform="meta",
    impressions=5000,
    clicks=250,
    conversions=15,
    spend=50.0,
    revenue=150.0,
    ctr=0.05,
    cvr=0.06,
    cpa=3.33,
    roas=3.0,
    start_time=datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(hours=1),
    end_time=datetime.utcnow()
)

recommendation = optimizer.optimize_bid(
    context=context,
    current_bid=2.0,
    avg_order_value=60.0,
    recent_performance=recent_performance
)

print(f"Current bid: ${recommendation.current_bid:.2f}")
print(f"Recommended bid: ${recommendation.recommended_bid:.2f}")
print(f"Change: ${recommendation.bid_change:.2f} ({recommendation.bid_change_pct:.1%})")
print(f"Expected CVR: {recommendation.expected_cvr:.2%}")
print(f"Expected CPA: ${recommendation.expected_cpa:.2f}")
print(f"Expected ROAS: {recommendation.expected_roas:.2f}x")
print(f"Confidence: {recommendation.confidence:.0%}")
print(f"Reasoning: {recommendation.reasoning}")
```

### 3. Multi-Platform Budget Allocation

**File:** `app/optimization/budget_allocator.py`

**Class:** `MultiPlatformBudgetAllocator`

**Approach:**
1. **Platform-level allocation** - Distribute budget across platforms based on aggregate ROAS
2. **Campaign-level allocation** - Within each platform, optimize across campaigns

**Usage Example:**
```python
from app.optimization import MultiPlatformBudgetAllocator

allocator = MultiPlatformBudgetAllocator()

platform_campaigns = {
    "meta": [campaign1, campaign2, campaign3],
    "google_search": [campaign4, campaign5],
    "linkedin": [campaign6]
}

platform_constraints = {
    "meta": {"min": 100.0, "max": 5000.0},
    "google_search": {"min": 100.0, "max": 3000.0},
    "linkedin": {"min": 50.0, "max": 1000.0}
}

results = allocator.optimize_cross_platform(
    platform_campaigns=platform_campaigns,
    total_budget=10000.0,
    platform_constraints=platform_constraints
)

for platform, allocations in results.items():
    platform_total = sum(a.recommended_budget for a in allocations)
    print(f"{platform}: ${platform_total:.2f}")
    for allocation in allocations:
        print(f"  {allocation.campaign_id}: ${allocation.recommended_budget:.2f}")
```

## Production Optimization Engine

**File:** `app/optimization_engine.py`

**Class:** `CampaignOptimizationEngine`

**Capabilities:**
1. **Budget Optimization** - Uses BudgetAllocator
2. **Bid Optimization** - Uses BidOptimizer
3. **Targeting Refinement** - Suggests audience changes for poor performers
4. **Creative Rotation** - Suggests creative refresh for low CTR

**Usage Example:**
```python
from app.optimization_engine import (
    CampaignOptimizationEngine,
    PerformanceMetrics,
    OptimizationType
)

engine = CampaignOptimizationEngine(target_roas=2.0)

metrics = PerformanceMetrics(
    campaign_id="campaign_001",
    platform="meta",
    impressions=10000,
    clicks=500,
    conversions=50,
    spend=100.0,
    revenue=300.0,
    ctr=0.05,
    cpc=0.20,
    cpa=2.0,
    roas=3.0
)

recommendations = await engine.analyze_campaign_performance(
    metrics=metrics,
    total_budget=200.0,
    avg_order_value=60.0,
    bid_context={
        "ad_set_id": "adset_001",
        "device_type": "desktop",
        "placement": "feed"
    }
)

for rec in recommendations:
    print(f"\n{rec.optimization_type.value}:")
    print(f"  Priority: {rec.priority.value}")
    print(f"  Current: ${rec.current_value:.2f}")
    print(f"  Recommended: ${rec.recommended_value:.2f}")
    print(f"  Confidence: {rec.confidence_score:.0%}")
    print(f"  Reasoning: {rec.reasoning}")
    print(f"  Auto-execute: {rec.auto_execute}")
```

---

## Optimization Executor

**File:** `app/optimization_engine.py`

**Class:** `OptimizationExecutor`

**Key Features:**
- **Dry run mode** - Simulate execution without making changes
- **Approval requirements** - Only auto-execute high-confidence recommendations
- **Execution history** - Track all optimizations
- **Rollback capability** - Undo last optimization
- **Safety checks** - Validate before execution

**Usage Example:**
```python
from app.optimization_engine import OptimizationExecutor

# Dry run mode (simulation)
executor = OptimizationExecutor(dry_run=True, require_approval=True)

for recommendation in recommendations:
    result = await executor.execute_optimization(
        recommendation=recommendation,
        platform_client=None  # Would be Meta/Google API client
    )

    print(f"Status: {result['status']}")
    print(f"Message: {result['message']}")

    if result['success']:
        print(f"Changes: {result['changes_applied']}")

# View execution history
history = executor.get_execution_history(campaign_id="campaign_001")

# Rollback if needed
rollback_result = executor.rollback_last_execution("campaign_001")
```

## Key Improvements Over Stub Implementation

### Before (Stub):
```python
# Simple mock recommendation
if metrics.roas < 2.0:
    recommendations.append(OptimizationRecommendation(
        recommended_value=metrics.spend * 0.8,  # Just reduce by 20%
        reasoning="ROAS below target threshold"
    ))
```

### After (Production):
```python
# Real mathematical optimization
campaign_perf = CampaignPerformance(...)

# Use gradient ascent optimizer
allocations = self.budget_allocator.optimize(
    campaigns=[campaign_perf],
    total_budget=total_budget
)

# Use bid optimizer with conversion probability
bid_rec = self.bid_optimizer.optimize_bid(
    context=context,
    current_bid=current_bid,
    avg_order_value=avg_order_value,
    recent_performance=recent_performance
)

## Usage in Production

### 1. Budget Optimization
```python
# Analyze multiple campaigns and get budget recommendations
engine = CampaignOptimizationEngine(target_roas=2.0)

for campaign in campaigns:
    recommendations = await engine.analyze_campaign_performance(
        metrics=campaign.metrics,
        total_budget=total_budget
    )

    # Execute high-confidence recommendations automatically
    executor = OptimizationExecutor(dry_run=False, require_approval=True)
    for rec in recommendations:
        if rec.auto_execute:
            await executor.execute_optimization(rec, platform_client)
```

### 2. Bid Optimization
```python
# Optimize bids for all ad sets in a campaign
contexts = [
    BidContext(campaign_id=c.id, ad_set_id=a.id, platform=c.platform, ...)
    for c in campaigns
    for a in c.ad_sets
]

current_bids = {a.id: a.current_bid for c in campaigns for a in c.ad_sets}

recommendations = bid_optimizer.optimize_campaign_bids(
    contexts=contexts,
    current_bids=current_bids,
    avg_order_value=60.0,
    performance_data=recent_performance
)
```

### 3. Dynamic Adjustment
```python
# Quick reaction to performance changes
dynamic = DynamicBidAdjustment(check_interval_minutes=60)

if dynamic.should_adjust(recent_performance, target_roas=2.0):
    multiplier = dynamic.calculate_emergency_adjustment(recent_performance, 2.0)
    # Apply multiplier to all bids in campaign
```
