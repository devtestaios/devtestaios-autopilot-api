## Detailed Accomplishments

### 1. Budget Allocation Optimizer ✅

**File:** `app/optimization/budget_allocator.py` (378 lines)

**Mathematical Approach:**
- **Power Law Model:** Revenue = a * Budget^b (b=0.8 for diminishing returns)
- **Gradient Ascent:** Equalize marginal ROAS across campaigns
- **Constraint Satisfaction:** Min/max budgets, total budget constraint
- **Convergence Detection:** Stops when changes < threshold

**Classes Created:**
1. **CampaignPerformance** - Input data for optimization
   - Campaign metrics (impressions, clicks, conversions)
   - Spend and revenue
   - Calculated metrics (CTR, CPC, CPA, ROAS)
   - Optional constraints (min/max budget)

2. **BudgetAllocation** - Optimization result
   - Current vs recommended budget
   - Budget change amount and percentage
   - Expected revenue and ROAS
   - Confidence score

3. **BudgetAllocator** - Main optimization engine
   - `optimize()` - Optimize budget across campaigns
   - `_marginal_roas()` - Calculate marginal ROAS at budget level
   - `_estimate_revenue()` - Estimate revenue for budget
   - `_estimate_roas()` - Estimate ROAS for budget
   - `_calculate_confidence()` - Confidence in recommendation

4. **MultiPlatformBudgetAllocator** - Cross-platform optimization
   - `optimize_cross_platform()` - Allocate across platforms
   - `_allocate_platform_budgets()` - Platform-level allocation
   - Two-stage optimization: platform → campaign

**Key Algorithm:**
```python
for iteration in range(max_iterations):
    # Calculate marginal ROAS for each campaign
    gradients = {c.id: marginal_roas(c, budget) for c in campaigns}

    # Move budget toward campaigns with higher marginal ROAS
    for campaign in campaigns:
        if gradient[campaign] > avg_gradient:
            increase_budget(campaign)  # Scale up
        else:
            decrease_budget(campaign)  # Scale down

    # Enforce constraints and normalize to total budget
    apply_constraints()
    normalize_to_total()

    # Check convergence
    if max_change < threshold:
        break
```

**Features:**
- Automatic convergence (typically 20-50 iterations)
- Respects min/max budget constraints
- Handles single or multiple campaigns
- Cross-platform optimization
- Confidence scoring based on data quality

---

### 2. Bid Optimization Algorithm ✅

**File:** `app/optimization/bid_optimizer.py` (467 lines)

**Mathematical Approach:**
- **Optimal Bid Formula:** bid = (value * cvr) / target_roas
- **Contextual Adjustments:** Device, time-of-day, placement multipliers
- **Performance Multiplier:** Scale up/down based on recent ROAS

**Classes Created:**

   - Device type, placement, time
   - Historical CVR, CPA, ROAS

2. **BidRecommendation** - Bid optimization result

   - Bid change amount and percentage
   - Expected CVR, CPA, ROAS
   - Confidence score
   - Human-readable reasoning

3. **PerformanceSnapshot** - Recent performance data
   - Last hour/day metrics
   - Used for quick bid adjustments
   - Time range tracking

4. **BidOptimizer** - Main bid optimization engine
   - `optimize_bid()` - Calculate optimal bid for context
   - `optimize_campaign_bids()` - Optimize multiple ad sets
   - `_estimate_conversion_rate()` - Estimate CVR from context
   - `_calculate_performance_multiplier()` - Adjust based on performance
   - `_calculate_confidence()` - Confidence in recommendation
   - `_generate_reasoning()` - Explain recommendation

5. **DynamicBidAdjustment** - Emergency bid adjustments
   - `should_adjust()` - Determine if adjustment needed
   - `calculate_emergency_adjustment()` - Quick reaction multiplier

**Key Algorithm:**
```python
def optimize_bid(context, current_bid, avg_order_value):
    # 1. Estimate conversion rate
    base_cvr = context.historical_cvr

    # Weight recent vs historical performance
    if recent_performance:
        cvr = (0.7 * recent_cvr) + (0.3 * base_cvr)

    # Apply contextual multipliers
    if hour_of_day in peak_hours:
        cvr *= 1.1  # +10% during peak
    if device == "desktop":
        cvr *= 1.15  # +15% for desktop
    if placement == "feed":
        cvr *= 1.1  # +10% for feed

    # 2. Calculate optimal bid
    optimal_bid = (avg_order_value * cvr) / target_roas

    # 3. Apply performance multiplier
    if recent_roas > target_roas:
        optimal_bid *= 1.0 + learning_rate * (roas_ratio - 1.0)
    else:
        optimal_bid *= 1.0 - learning_rate * (1.0 - roas_ratio)

    # 4. Apply constraints
    recommended_bid = clamp(optimal_bid, min_bid, max_bid)
    recommended_bid = clamp(recommended_bid,
                            current_bid * (1 - max_change),
                            current_bid * (1 + max_change))

    return recommendation
```
